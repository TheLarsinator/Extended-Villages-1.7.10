Extended Villages

Extended Villages is a modification for Minecraft. The mod expands the vanilla villages with new building and villager
proffesions. You can find windmills, mining towers, fishing huts and even a lab. All villager will trade items with you in return
for some shiny emeralds, just like their vanilla buddies!
